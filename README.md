# A collection of iPython Notebooks.

There are plenty of notebooks here that are just scratch-ish, things I did to illustrate concepts to others at my work, but there are also some that do intersting things.

These are my most interesting ones:

### [visualize regions of hand curated possible ice in the nsidc0622 dataset](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/flamingbear/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/nsidc0622-valid-ice-polygon-extensions.ipynb)

### [use pandas to bend Sea Ice Extent into interesting statistics.](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/flamingbear/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Sea_Ice_Statistics.ipynb)
