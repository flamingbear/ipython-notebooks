# A collection of iPython Notebooks.

These will look funny on GitHub because in order to do a decent revision
control on ipython notebooks you need to save them after clearing all data.
I will add pointers to gists below for notebooks that I think are interesting
enough to show the full output.  Most of these are just scratch notebooks
I've created to describe something to other people or to learn how something works.
